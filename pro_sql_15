WHERE and ORDER BY

You can use the LIMIT clause in combination with other clauses, such as WHERE and ORDER BY, to further 
filter and sort the rows that are returned.

For example:
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year>2010 ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 10;

This SELECT statement will return the first 10 movies released after 2010, sorted alphabetically by title.
