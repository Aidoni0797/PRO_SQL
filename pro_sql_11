Simple SELECT queries

Here's an example of simple query:
SELECT title, year FROM movies;

This query would retrieve all rows from the movies table, and for each row it would return values in the title
and year columns.

For example, if the movies table contains the following rows:

title - year
The Green Mile - 1999
The Shawshank Redemption - 1994
The Dark Knight - 2008

Then the query:
SELECT title FROM movies;

Would return the following result:
title
The Gren Mile
The Shawshank Redemption
The Dark Knight
