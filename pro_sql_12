SELECT DISTINCT

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used in SQL to select only unique values from a table. It filters out any
duplicates to give you a result set with unique values.

Here is an example using a table called movies.

The movies table has the following structure:

id - title - genre
1 - The Shawshank Redemption - Drama
2 - The Godfather - Crime
3 - The Godfather: Part II - Crime
4 - The Dark Knight - Action
5 - 12 Angry Men - Drama
6 - Schindler's List - Drama
7 - Pulp Fiction - Crime
8 - The Lord of the Rings - Fantasy
9 - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - Western

To select only unique genres from the movies table, you can use the following. SELECT DISTINCT statement:

SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies;

This will return the following result set:
genre
Drama
Crime
Action
Fantasy
Western

Note that the result set only includes one row for each unique value in the genre column. Any duplicates are removed.

You can also use the SELECT DISTINCT statement in conjuction with other SELECT clauses, such as WHERE and ORDER BY.
For example, the following statement selects all unique genres from the movies table and sorts them alphabetically.

SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies ORDER BY genre ASC;

This will return the following result set:
genre
Action
Crime
Drama
Fantasy
Western
