Ordering Data

In SQL, you can use the ORDER BY clause to specify the order in which rows are returned in a result set.

The ORDER BY clause comes after the FROM clause in a SELECT statement and is used to sort the result set based on one
or more columns.

Here is an example using a table called movies:
SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY title ASC;

This statement selects all rows from the movies table and sorts the result set by the title column in
ascending order (ASC).

ASC for ASCENDING and DESC for DESCENDING

Note: ASC is the default sort order.

Ordering Data by multiple columns

You can also sort the result set by multiple columns.
For example:
SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY genre ASC, title ASC;

This statement sorts the result set first by the genre column in ascending order, and then by the title column 
in ascending order. The result set will be ordered first by  genre (A to Z) and then by title within each genre 
(A to Z).
