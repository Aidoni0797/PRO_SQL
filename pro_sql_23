Here is an example of using the ANY operator in a WHERE clause to check if a value matches any value returned by a subquery:

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year = ANY (SELECT release_year FROM top_rated_movies) ORDER BY release_year;

This query will return  all rows from the movies table where the release_year column has a value that is returned by the subquery SELECT release_year FROM
