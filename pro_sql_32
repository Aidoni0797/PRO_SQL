INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN is a type of join in SQL that combines rows from two or more tables based on a common column between them.
When you use INNER JOIN, only the rows that have matching values in th common will be included in the result set.

Table movies
Table reviews

To use INNER JOIN  with the movies and reviews tables, you can write a SELECT statement like this:
SELECT movies.title, movies.genre, reviews.review FROM movies INNER JOIN reviews ON movies.id = reviews.movie_id;

This SELECT statement combines rows from the movies and reviews tables based on the id column  in the movies table matching the movie_id column in the reviews table. The ON clause
specifies the relationship between the two tables, using the = operator to indicate that the id and movie_id values must match for the rows to be included in the result test.

The result set will have row for each movie that has a reviews table, with the movie's id, title, genre and review included in the row. If a movie in the movies table does not have
a corresponding row in the reviews table, it will be included in the result set.
