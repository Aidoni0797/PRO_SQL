Views

In SQL, a view is a virtual table is based on a SELECT statement.
A view contains no data itself, but displays data from one or more tables in the database.

Views can be used to provide a specific perspective on the data in a database, or to restrict access to certain rows or columns of data. THey can be used to simplify complex queries. or to provide
a consistent interface for users who need to access data in different ways.

Here is an example of how to create a view in SQL:

CREATE VIEW top_rated_movies
AS
SELECT id, title, release_year, genre, rating FROM movies WHERE rating=9;

This view creates a virtual table that displays all rows from the movies table where the rating column is equal to 9.
To query a view, you can use it just like a regular table:
SELECT * FROM top_rated_movies;
This SELECT statement retrieves all rows from the top_rated_movies view.
