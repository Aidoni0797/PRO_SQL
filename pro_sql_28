Function MAX

The MAX function in SQL is used toretrieve the maximum value in a given column of a table.
id - title - release_year - genre - rating
1 - The Shawshank Redemption - 1994 - Drama - 9
2 - The Godfather - 1972 - Crime - 9
3 - The Godfather: Part II - 1974 - Crime - 9
4 - The Dark Knight - 2008 - Action - 9
5 - 12 Angry Men - 1957 - Drama - 8
6 - Schindlers List - 1993 - Biograpgy - 8
7 - Pulp Fiction - 1994 - Crime - 8
8 - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 2003 - Adventure - 8
9 - Fight Club - 1999 - Drama - 8

Here is an example of how you might use the MAX function in a SQL query to find the maximum value in the release_year column of a table called movies

SELECT MAX(relese_year) FROM movies;

This query would return the maximum value in the release_year column of the movies table. If the releasE_year column contains NULL values, the MAX function will ignonre them.

MAX(release_year)
2008

You can also use a WHERE clause in your query to narow down the results to a specific subset of the table. For example, if you want to fond the maximum value in the release_year column 
for movies that have a genre of Action, you can use the following query:
SELECT MAX(release_year)
FROM movies WHERE genre = 'Action';

MAX()
