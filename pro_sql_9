Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) - is a declarative programming language that serves as the standard language for working with relational databases. It is used for creating,
modifying and managing the structure of a database, as well as for executing queries on the database to retrieve data from it.

SQL is used in the majority of modern Database Managment System (DBMS) such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and many others.

Brief History of SQL

The SQL language emerged after the development of ralational algebra, with its prototype being created in the late 1970s at IBM Research. It was implemented in the first prototype
of the IBM System R relational DBMS. Since then, this language has been used by many commercial DBMSs and became so popular that it gradually becamethe de facto standard language
for data manipulation in relational DBMSs.

Relational algebra is a closed system of operations over relations in the relational data model. Operations of relational algebra are also referred to as relational operations.

Initially, the language was named SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), but later the word English was dropped from the acronym. On the other hand, it has been referred to as a
"complete database language" almost from the beginnig.

SQ includes:

- Facilties for defining and managing the database schema.
- Facilties for defining integrity constraints and triggers.
- Facilties for defining  database views.
- Facilties for authorizing access to relations and their fields.
- Facilties for defining physical-level structures that support efficient query execution.
- Facilties for defining transaction savepoints and performing transaction commits and rollbacks.
