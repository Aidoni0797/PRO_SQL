Filtering Data
Filtering in SQL is the process of selecting only certain rows from a table or query result set that meet specific criteria.

You can use the WHERE clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE statement to filter rows based on one or more conditions.

Here is the basic syntax for using the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Look at this example:

SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter rows from a movies table in a SQL database:
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year>2010 AND rating='PG';

This query would select all rows from the movies table where the year column is greater than 2010 and the rating column is equal to PG.
